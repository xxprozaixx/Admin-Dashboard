# Admin-Dashboard
Basic Admin Dashboard (The Odin Project)

This will help me to revise everything I learn previously in the intermediate CSS Course, features like positioning, flexbox, grid, and more html/css properties.

### Conclusionn
After finishign the project, I could tackle the layout easily. The problem is efficiency, I felt there are many other better ways to do this. I most likely wrote a lot of redundant code but as for now, I could do then it's fine. Another thing is that Im still bad at responsive layout. TOP havent thought much about it yet.
